This disruptive technology has helped healthcare professionals with intervening early in chronic diseases, especially amongst independently living patients, and has facilitated real-time monitoring of patients' vital signs remotely. One of the major bottlenecks that hamper the adoption of wearable device is the continuous power supply. Most wearable devices solely depend on battery supply. When the energy stored in the battery is depleted, the operation of wearable devices is affected. To overcome this limitation, efficient energy harvesters for wearable devices are crucial. The paper primarily aims to present a comprehensive classification of different energy sources that can be capitalized to power wearable devices.

This review highlights the abundant source of RF-EH from the surroundings sources, including nearby mobile phones, Wi-Fi, wireless local area network, broadcast television signal or DTS, and FM/AM radio signals. In contrast, the energy is captured by a receiving antenna and rectified into a working direct current voltage. This review also summarizes the power of RF-EH technology, which would provide a guideline for developing RF-EH units. The energy harvesting circuits depend on cutting-edge electrical technology to achieve significant efficiency, given that they are built to perform with considerably small current and voltage.

  abstract = {Electric devices has become a necessity in modern smart societies. The energy research community is continually exploring new solutions that can be employed as potential and reliable alternatives to satisfy future energy requirements in this context. Triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators (TNGs/PNGs) are considered promising renewable energy harvesting technologies. TNGs/PNGs are gaining considerable research attention because of their advantages such as ease of fabrication, cost effectiveness, flexibility, lightweightness, long-term-durability, and excellent output performance. The TNGs/PNGs have enormous potential in harvesting energy from water waves (blue energy), airflow (wind energy), sound frequency (acoustic energy), vibrations/mechanical motions (such as body motions activities/sleeping), and in vivo body motions. These technologies are thus an ``all-in-one package,'' which is a unique selling point. The advantage of this technology is that all sources are natural and abundant. This paper provides a review of the potential use of PNGs/TNGs and includes a description of the rise of nanogenerators, their underlying mechanisms, different materials used, various models, possible applications, and future prospects. Stored energy can be used to develop smart/informative technologies (as ultrasensitive sensors) and self-powered biomedical science. Owing to their considerable effects, these harvesting technologies are expected to dominate the future smart world.},

  abstract = {Wearable and mobile devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, wearable medical devices, etc., have become an important part of our daily life. Most of these devices are powered by electrochemical batteries, which have limited energy capacity, need periodic replacement or recharging, and lead to environmental concerns. On the one hand, there is a huge amount of energy stored in the human body and the energy dissipation rate is more than 100 Watts. While on the other hand, the power requirement of typical wearable and mobile devices is less than 1 Watt and keeps decreasing as a result of the rapid development of technologies. Extracting a small amount of energy from the human body can provide enough power for wearable/mobile devices, and enable a convenient, sustainable, eco-friendly, and self-powered alternative to batteries. Many biomechanical energy-harvesting devices have emerged in recent years, of which the excitation source, mechanical modulation, energy conversion method, and performance are vastly different from one another. However, no comprehensive work has been found in the literature that conducted systematical review of the pioneer works from the perspective of modeling of biomechanical energy harvesters. This work reviews the modeling and performance of the state-of-the-art biomechanical energy harvesting devices and classifies them into three categories in terms of excitation mechanisms, specifically, relative-motion-excited, inertia-excited, and force-excited. Different energy-conversion transducers are analyzed and compared, including electromagnetic, piezoelectric, electrostatic, and triboelectric. The evaluation metrics are defined for fair comparisons. The results show that biomechanical energy harvesting has a promising application prospect in many areas, such as health care monitoring systems and wearable electronics, and the current power output and density could be up to 5~W and 10~W/kg. Energy harvesting from negative muscle work may reduce the metabolic cost of human motion while harvesting electrical power. Meanwhile, the review also reveals potential problems that hind the commercialization and practical applications of biomechanical energy harvesting technologies, such as the cost, invasiveness to human body, and interference to human dynamics.},

Wearable biosensors can receive information about human health without the need for external charging, with energy instead provided by collection and storage modules that can be integrated into the biosensors. However, the failure to design suitable components for sensing remains a significant challenge associated with biomedical sensors. Therefore, design of TENG structures based on the human body is a considerable challenge, as biomedical sensors, such as implantable and wearable self-powered sensors, have recently advanced. Following a brief introduction of the fundamentals of triboelectric nanogenerators, we describe implantable and wearable self-powered sensors powered by triboelectric nanogenerators.

Heat is a very common source to generate electric energy however the efficiency of equipment using heat as an energy generation source is limited, and it creates huge amounts of heat energy as waste.

After quick research, it is obvious that different active and passive devices can be manufactured not only for big size energy generators but also for the small size and wearable generators which use heat in order to create electric energy via TEGs. In this review, promising results gathered from different applications of TEGs in different industries claimed as well as the basic principles of thermoelectricity and fundamentals of energy harvesting process from temperature gradient. Experiments on TEGs were done by many researchers as well as analytical models through the years, and validated that TEGs are useful for the energy generation.

  abstract = {The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonrenewable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest energies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed. Briefly, this review presents the broad spectrum of piezoelectric materials for clean power supply to wireless electronics in diverse fields.},

  abstract = {There has been an explosion in research focused on Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, with a broad range of use cases in different domains ranging from industrial automation to business analytics. Being battery-powered, these small devices are expected to last for extended periods (i.e., in some instances up to tens of years) to ensure network longevity and data streams with the required temporal and spatial granularity. It becomes even more critical when IoT devices are installed within a harsh environment where battery replacement/charging is both costly and labour intensive. Recent developments in the energy harvesting paradigm have significantly contributed towards mitigating this critical energy issue by incorporating the renewable energy potentially available within any environment in which a sensor network is deployed. Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting is one of the promising approaches being investigated in the research community to address this challenge, conducted by harvesting energy from the incident radio waves from both ambient and dedicated radio sources. A limited number of studies are available covering the state of the art related to specific research topics in this space, but there is a gap in the consolidation of domain knowledge associated with the factors influencing the performance of RF power harvesting systems. Moreover, a number of topics and research challenges affecting the performance of RF harvesting systems are still unreported, which deserve special attention. To this end, this article starts by providing an overview of the different application domains of RF power harvesting outlining their performance requirements and summarizing the RF power harvesting techniques with their associated power densities. It then comprehensively surveys the available literature on the horizons that affect the performance of RF energy harvesting, taking into account the evaluation metrics, power propagation models, rectenna architectures, and MAC protocols for RF energy harvesting. Finally, it summarizes the available literature associated with RF powered networks and highlights the limitations, challenges, and future research directions by synthesizing the research efforts in the field of RF energy harvesting to progress research in this area.},

Emerging implantable and wearable medical (IWM) devices are integral parts of enabling affordable and accessible healthcare. Early disease diagnosis and preventive measures are possible by continuously monitoring clinically significant physiological parameters. However, most IWM devices are battery-operated, requiring replacement, which interrupts the proper functioning of these devices. For the continuous operation of medical devices for an extended period of time, supplying uninterrupted energy is crucial. A sustainable and health-compatible energy supply will ensure the high-performance real-time functioning of IWM devices and prolong their lifetime.

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence and miniaturization of electronic devices have driven global efforts to develop small-scale, self-sustaining, rugged, and ecologically viable power sources. Nanogenerators, with the ability to scavenge ambient energy from the environment, offer an elegant solution to this need for small-scale power sources. A major route of development for nanogenerators has been in integration with other green energy sources. This article discusses one such integrated power source, namely the photovoltaic and nanogenerator hybrid cells. These hybrid cells have come a long way in terms of mechanical integrity, power output, and efficiency since they were first reported in 2009. Each published instance of photovoltaic and nanogenerator hybrid cell is reviewed systematically and the salient points in each case have been discussed. The article has been concluded with a discussion on the current state of this technology, its limitations, and the avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancements of wearable electronics have caused a paradigm shift in consumer electronics, and the emerging development of stretchable electronics opens a new spectrum of applications for electronic systems. Playing a critical role as the power sources for independent electronic systems, energy harvesters with high flexibility or stretchability have been the focus of research efforts over the past decade. A large number of the flexible energy harvesters developed can only operate at very low strain level ({$\approx$}0.1\%), and their limited flexibility impedes their application in wearable or stretchable electronics. Here, the development of highly flexible and stretchable (stretchability {$>$}15\% strain) energy harvesters is reviewed with emphasis on strategies of materials synthesis, device fabrication, and integration schemes for enhanced flexibility and stretchability. Due to their particular potential applications in wearable and stretchable electronics, energy-harvesting devices based on piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, thermoelectricity, and dielectric elastomers have been largely developed and the progress is summarized. The challenges and opportunities of assembly and integration of energy harvesters into stretchable systems are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Implantable technologies are becoming more widespread for biomedical applications that include physical identification, health diagnosis, monitoring, recording, and treatment of human physiological traits. However, energy harvesting and power generation beneath the human tissue are still a major challenge. In this regard, self-powered implantable devices that scavenge energy from the human body are attractive for long-term monitoring of human physiological traits. Thanks to advancements in material science and nanotechnology, energy harvesting techniques that rely on piezoelectricity, thermoelectricity, biofuel, and radio frequency power transfer are emerging. However, all these techniques suffer from limitations that include low power output, bulky size, or low efficiency. Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion is one of the most promising candidates for implantable applications due to their higher-power conversion efficiencies and small footprint. Herein, the latest implantable energy harvesting technologies are surveyed. A comparison between the different state-of-the-art power harvesting methods is also provided. Finally, recommendations are provided regarding the feasibility of PV cells as an in vivo energy harvester, with an emphasis on skin penetration, fabrication, encapsulation, durability, biocompatibility, and power management.},

  abstract = {Wearable and implantable bio-integrated electronics have started to gain momentum because of their essential role in improving the quality of life for various patients and healthy individuals. However, their continuous operation is often limited by traditional battery technologies with a limited lifespan, creating a significant challenge for their development. Thus, it is highly desirable to harvest biomechanical energies from human motion for self-powered bio-integrated functional devices. Piezoelectric energy harvesters are ideal candidates to achieve this goal by converting biomechanical energy to electric energy. Because of their applications on soft and highly deformable tissues of the human body, these devices also need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable, thus posing a significant challenge. Effective methods to address the challenge include the exploration of new stretchable piezoelectric materials (e.g., hybrid composite material) and stretchable structures (e.g., buckled shapes, serpentine mesh layouts, kirigami designs, among others). This review presents an overview of the recent developments in new intrinsically stretchable piezoelectric materials and rigid inorganic piezoelectric materials with novel stretchable structures for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesters. Following the discussion of theoretical modeling of the piezoelectric materials to convert mechanical deformations into electrical signals, the representative applications of stretchable piezoelectric materials and structures in wearable and implantable devices are briefly summarized. The present limitations and future research directions of flexible and stretchable piezoelectric devices are then discussed.},

However, powering wearable bioelectronics sustainably and pervasively is beyond the capability of traditional power supply systems and remains a challenge and highly desired. By using the coupling effect of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) were demonstrated to efficiently convert irregular and low-frequency biomechanical energy from human body movements into electrical energy for the sustainable powering of wearable bioelectronics. In this article, the latest representative achievements of wearable TENGs for electricity generation are comprehensively reviewed with the order of the accessible biomechanical energy on the human body from head to feet. This review not only covers the fundamental working mechanism, rational structural design, selection of the tribo-materials, and fabrication process of wearable TENGs, but also investigates the movement patterns and characteristics of each part of the body, as well as its feasibility and convenience for electricity generation. Finally, perspectives and challenges regarding wearable TENGs at present are discussed.},
