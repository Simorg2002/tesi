  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress made in energy harvesting systems for wearable technology. An energy-harvesting system would be a useful strategy to address the issue of powering wearable electronic devices. This review presents different wearable energy harvesting methods based on the human body's heat and mechanical energy. To achieve continuous operation and high performance, reduce the requirement for external sources of energy, and enhance the lifespan of wearable devices, the invention of a sustainable and compatible power supply is required. In the human body, heat and mechanical motions are the two reliable and readily available energy sources. This study highlights the most recent research and advancements in energy harvesting from the human's mechanical motion and heat source. This article provides a detailed overview of the different wearable energy harvesters, their fabrication, working, and output results, which include piezoelectric, electrostatic, triboelectric, electromagnetic, thermoelectric, solar and hybrid wearable energy harvesters. The second part defines wearable energy harvesting using smart systems and artificial intelligence technology. Then the comparison of these energy harvesters is analyzed. Hybrid wearable energy harvesters provide the maximum power densities because they use two combined energy conversions. The advantages, limitations, and future perspectives of wearable energy harvesting technology are also discussed. Lastly, the wearable energy harvesters' market, and general developing and manufacturing cost of each wearable device is also presented functioning as a point of reference to comprehend the cost factors that are taken into account during the development and manufacturing processes.},

  abstract = {A vibration energy harvesting system based on fully printed piezoelectric transducers is realized. The transducers have a butterfly-like architecture based on two single-optimized cantilevers with a resonance frequency tuned to 49.5 Hz and can be easily mounted to an industrial engine. By comparing single- and multistack configurations of the piezoelectric layers combined with full-wave or voltage doubler rectifiers, the power transfer characteristics and impedance can be matched to the electrical requirements of the sensing circuitry. A single stack with 21 {$\mu$}m thickness results in the maximum power output of 14.4 {$\mu$}W at a vibration velocity of 11.5 mm s-1, typical for industrial engines. The system is used to power a wireless sensor node on a 1 kW rotary pump in normal operation. The system can harvest up to 138 mJ within 24 h, sufficient for daily remote monitoring of the engine's vibration spectrum and temperature state. The system is thus suitable as a low-cost, ecofriendly power source for industrial IoT applications.},

Thus, the measurement of electromagnetic radiation is needed. This experiment aims to identify the SAR from wearable wireless devices (WWD). Measurement is conducted in a wearable health monitoring wearable wireless device (WWD) especially smartwatch. The smartwatch is modeled by planar inverted-F antenna and It will be placed on the human wrist phantom which filled by tissue liquid. The E-field probe is used to measure the electric field inside the liquid during the WWD is operated, at the frequency of 2.45 GHz, which is generated by the signal generator. The electric field is measured from wrist phantom with condition empty and filled by human tissue liquid. Based on the measurement data results, the electric field pattern distribution of the empty and filled liquid tissue equivalents have different patterns at the frequency 2.45 GHz. The area near the smartwatch model has the higher value for both measurements. The maximum RMS electric field without liquid is 42.76 V/m at the coordinate (30,15) and for the measurement with liquid is 18.95 V/m at the coordinate (35,20). The maximum SAR for this measurement is 0.70 Watt/kg. Statistically, there are significantly different in the electric field pattern between the phantom without and with liquid. The arm model is effectively used as the tool to test the SAR for the WWD model.},

However, previous s-TEGs show low power generation capacity due to their high module resistances, originating from the poor electromechanical interfaces between rigid--soft components and the high electrical resistances of stretchable interconnects. Herein, we report strategies to boost thermoelectric performance, which allows us to operate wireless communication systems from body heat by generating a power of 2.6 mW. Electromechanically graded interlayers that mediate discrete functionalities at the interfaces effectively reduce junction resistances, and solution-based welding that transforms scattered networks into mesh-like structures produces highly conductive and strain-resilient interconnects, respectively. Soft heat conductors are included to improve thermal interfaces, minimizing thermal impedance of elastomeric substrates. Consequently, the power generation capacity is significantly enhanced, exhibiting the highest normalized power density of 1.48 {$\mu$}W cm--2 K--2 among reported high-performance s-TEGs. Our s-TEGs provide realistic solutions for sustainable self-powered electronics.},

However, improving the output energy and durability of TENG remains a considerable challenge for practical applications. To solve these problems and push forward its commercialization process, this paper systematically reviews how to improve the durability of the sliding mode TENG (S-TENG) from the aspects of material optimization and structural design. Besides, a variety of ways are introduced to improve the electric output of the S-TENG under the premise of high durability.

With the high sensitivity to vibration changes, the hybrid energy harvester can also be used to monitor the state of the mechanisms while collecting vibration energy, avoiding accidents and economic losses caused by malfunction. In this work, we designed a highly integrated device that combines energy harvesting and sensing detection functions. The main structure uses magnetic permeable materials to form a unique electromagnetic generator (EMG) with magnetic circuit switching. Piezoelectric generator (PEG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) are distributed on both sides of the cantilever beam, and the three structures are integrated together through the cantilever beam, which not only makes full use of the structural space of the device, but also improves the power generation efficiency. Under the excitation of a vibration frequency of 8 Hz and an acceleration of 2 g, the peak power of the EMG, PEG, and TENG modules were 22 mW, 1.9 mW, and 48 {$\mu$}W, respectively. TENG unit was selected for identifying the gear state, achieving an accuracy rate of 93\% in tests. Ultimately, the hybrid generator was applied to a car engine, successfully powering a thermometer or sensing detection systems, realizing timely signal transmission.

However, with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), higher standards for comfort, multifunctionality, and sustainable operation of wearable electronics have been proposed, and it remains challenging to meet all the requirements of currently reported thermoelectric devices. Herein, we present a multifunctional, wearable, and wireless sensing system based on a thermoelectric knitted fabric with over 600~mm{$\cdot$}s-1 air permeability and a stretchability of 120\%. The device coupled with a wireless transmission system realizes self-powered monitoring of human respiration through an mobile phone application (APP). Furthermore, an integrated thermoelectric system was designed to combine photothermal conversion and passive radiative cooling, enabling the characteristics of being powered by solar-driven in-plane temperature differences and monitoring outdoor sunlight intensity through the APP. Additionally, we decoupled the complex signals of resistance and thermal voltage during deformation under solar irradiation based on the anisotropy of the knitted fabrics to enable the device to monitor and optimize the outdoor physical activity of the athlete via the APP. This novel thermoelectric fabric-based wearable and wireless sensing platform has promising applications in next-generation smart textiles.},

This advanced technology offers the supply of wireless power that is applicable for battery-free devices, which makes it a prospective alternative energy source for future applications. In addition to the dynamic energy recharging of wireless devices and a wide range of environmentally friendly energy source options, the emergence of the RF-EH technology is advantageous in facilitating various applications that require quality of service. This review highlights the abundant source of RF-EH from the surroundings sources, including nearby mobile phones, Wi-Fi, wireless local area network, broadcast television signal or DTS, and FM/AM radio signals. In contrast, the energy is captured by a receiving antenna and rectified into a working direct current voltage. This review also summarizes the power of RF-EH technology, which would provide a guideline for developing RF-EH units. The energy harvesting circuits depend on cutting-edge electrical technology to achieve significant efficiency, given that they are built to perform with considerably small current and voltage. Hence, the review includes a thorough analysis and discussion of various RF designs and their pros and cons. Finally, the latest applications of RF-EH are presented.},

  abstract = {Myopia presents a formidable challenge, especially in children, where clinical management involves the use of atropine and 7-methylxanthine, necessitating multiple doses, strong side effects and encountering suboptimal compliance due to children's resistance. In response to these issues, our research proposes a self-generated electricity-driven drug delivery system (EDDDS) designed for precision myopia treatment. The EDDDS intelligently releases therapeutic drugs, such as atropine, at ocular tissues using drug-coated nanogenerators, aiming to effectively slow down the progression of myopia. This system combines nanotechnology and smart drug delivery mechanisms to achieve controlled and responsive drug administration. The nanogenerators embedded in the EDDDS generate electric fields that trigger drug release upon closing eyes conditions, providing targeted treatment. Simultaneously, the weak voltage can effectively relieve the ciliary muscle, offering additional benefits for myopia management. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated the efficacy and potential of the EDDDS in precisely modulating myopia progression. The proposed EDDDS holds significant promise as an advanced and high-precision therapeutic approach for myopia management. Its potential to address the limitations of current treatments makes it a promising avenue for future research and clinical applications.},

The energy research community is continually exploring new solutions that can be employed as potential and reliable alternatives to satisfy future energy requirements in this context. Triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators (TNGs/PNGs) are considered promising renewable energy harvesting technologies. TNGs/PNGs are gaining considerable research attention because of their advantages such as ease of fabrication, cost effectiveness, flexibility, lightweightness, long-term-durability, and excellent output performance. The TNGs/PNGs have enormous potential in harvesting energy from water waves (blue energy), airflow (wind energy), sound frequency (acoustic energy), vibrations/mechanical motions (such as body motions activities/sleeping), and in vivo body motions. These technologies are thus an ``all-in-one package,'' which is a unique selling point. The advantage of this technology is that all sources are natural and abundant. This paper provides a review of the potential use of PNGs/TNGs and includes a description of the rise of nanogenerators, their underlying mechanisms, different materials used, various models, possible applications, and future prospects. Stored energy can be used to develop smart/informative technologies (as ultrasensitive sensors) and self-powered biomedical science. Owing to their considerable effects, these harvesting technologies are expected to dominate the future smart world.},

The hybrid generator was assembled through simple drop-casting and gravitational settling effect, for the first time. The film layer sedimented with the conductive thermoelectric particles simultaneously served as an electrode and a bottom substrate for piezoelectric energy harvesting. The fabricated device generated outputs of 1~{$\mu$}A and 4~V at a temperature difference of 3~K and a bending displacement of 5~mm; these values indicate that the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects were combined well without compromising the energy harvesting performance of each part. Furthermore, the fabricated device exhibited robust mechanical durability for {$\sim$}5000 bending cycles; this result was better than those of previously reported flexible TPHGs (f-TPHGs). The proposed design concept for f-TPHGs can aid in the development of high-performance multisource energy harvesting devices for wearable sensors.},

The radiofrequency and triboelectric (RF-TE) hybrid energy harvester (HEH) concept and prototype is presented for the first time, to simultaneously capture the energy from ambient electromagnetic waves and biological motions. The proposed hybrid energy harvesting system consists of a wearable rectenna, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), and a power management circuit (PMC). Among them, the all-fabric rectenna exhibits good impedance matching characteristics in the ISM frequency. The flexible TENG unit can generate a maximum power density of 0.024~{\textmu}W~cm-2. The designed multifunctional fabric-based PMC can considerably enhance the controllability of harvested hybrid energy. Additionally, a normalizable fabric circuit board quasi surface mount technology (FCB-SMT) is proposed to integrate all modules on the same fabric substrate in one step, making the entire system superior mechanical robustness. The proposed wearable fabric-based RF-TE hybrid energy harvester is capable of successfully driving consumer electronics (such as sensors, watches, etc.). It provides a new energy solution strategy for self-powered wearable electronic devices and is anticipated to encourage the efficient utilization of renewable energy.},

However, most of the current intelligent face masks focus on monitoring single physical signal, which were unable to provide comprehensive information. Herein, an intelligent face mask with airflow and temperature sensing abilities, high-efficiency filtration and excellent antibacterial activity was proposed. The real-time airflow monitoring was realized by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which was composed of electrospun nanofibrous membrane and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite film. The fabricated electrospun nanofibrous membrane simultaneously played roles as tribo-positive material, filter and antibacterial membrane. The PDMS composite film prepared by co-blending and surface modification was applied as tribo-negative material. It was found that the combination of co-blending and surface modification enhanced the tribo-negative property of the PDMS film, resulting in an increment of output performance of TENG. The TENG integrated into a face mask could monitor respiratory rate and respiration intensity in real time. Additionally, the temperature sensing was achieved by a serpentine PDMS/laser-induced graphene temperature sensor. The temperature sensor exhibited a temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.316\% {$^\circ$}C-1, which could detect subtle temperature variations. Furthermore, the electrospun nanofibrous membrane exhibited excellent filtration performance and antibacterial activity. Therefore, the prepared intelligent face mask showed promising potential for healthcare applications.},

This article proposes a counter-rotating gear energy harvester (CG-EH) to convert the longitudinal vibration energy of trains into electricity for onboard sensors.CG-EH consists of a vibration input module, a motion conversion module, and an energy conversion module. The vibration input module converts the longitudinal displacement of the coupler into the rotational motion of the gears. The motion conversion module realizes the conversion of the reciprocating input displacement into the unidirectional rotation based on a counter-rotating gear set, multi-stage spur gear sets can effectively mitigate the effects of excitation on CG-EH. The energy conversion module transforms the kinetic energy of the unidirectional rotation into electrical energy through a generator. Experimental results show that the energy outputs of CG-EH are improved with longitudinal vibration compared with the usual onboard energy harvester. From the result, the peak output power of CG-EH is 14.59 W, the peak efficiency reaches 39.2\%, enough to power relevant onboard sensors. Moreover, CG-EH can monitor the running status of trains based on deep learning. From the experiment results and application prospects, CG-EH is a favorable solution for the power supply problems of onboard sensors in smart railways.},

  abstract = {Wearable and mobile devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, wearable medical devices, etc., have become an important part of our daily life. Most of these devices are powered by electrochemical batteries, which have limited energy capacity, need periodic replacement or recharging, and lead to environmental concerns. On the one hand, there is a huge amount of energy stored in the human body and the energy dissipation rate is more than 100 Watts. While on the other hand, the power requirement of typical wearable and mobile devices is less than 1 Watt and keeps decreasing as a result of the rapid development of technologies. Extracting a small amount of energy from the human body can provide enough power for wearable/mobile devices, and enable a convenient, sustainable, eco-friendly, and self-powered alternative to batteries. Many biomechanical energy-harvesting devices have emerged in recent years, of which the excitation source, mechanical modulation, energy conversion method, and performance are vastly different from one another. However, no comprehensive work has been found in the literature that conducted systematical review of the pioneer works from the perspective of modeling of biomechanical energy harvesters. This work reviews the modeling and performance of the state-of-the-art biomechanical energy harvesting devices and classifies them into three categories in terms of excitation mechanisms, specifically, relative-motion-excited, inertia-excited, and force-excited. Different energy-conversion transducers are analyzed and compared, including electromagnetic, piezoelectric, electrostatic, and triboelectric. The evaluation metrics are defined for fair comparisons. The results show that biomechanical energy harvesting has a promising application prospect in many areas, such as health care monitoring systems and wearable electronics, and the current power output and density could be up to 5~W and 10~W/kg. Energy harvesting from negative muscle work may reduce the metabolic cost of human motion while harvesting electrical power. Meanwhile, the review also reveals potential problems that hind the commercialization and practical applications of biomechanical energy harvesting technologies, such as the cost, invasiveness to human body, and interference to human dynamics.},

The interface employs an inductor-shared converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) assistance to convert the piezoelectric energy rectified by a parallel synchronized switch harvesting on capacitor (P-SSHC) rectifier and the thermoelectric energy into a regulated output. The harvester employs an adaptive switching cycle (ASC) scheme to reduce the ripple of the tracking to improve the MPPT accuracy and end-to-end efficiency. In parallel, for efficient harvesting of both sources simultaneously, a multiplexed MPPT technique is incorporated into the harvester to reduce the chip area. In addition, to reduce the power loss resulting from the sampling phase of the FOCV method, a single-cycle fast-sampling technique is employed to assist the piezoelectric energy harvesting. The proposed hybrid energy harvester is fabricated by a 0.18 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm CMOS process with a core area of 1.2 {\textbackslash}times 0.7 mm2.

These events often occur without apparent symptoms, posing a challenge for diabetic patients in managing their condition. Therefore, a non-invasive wearable device capable of continuously measuring multiple body signals to predict hypoglycemic events would be highly beneficial. In this study, a wearable patch that continuously measures glucose, temperature, and HRV is presented. The device uses a novel power harvesting system to convert radiofrequency (RF) signals with the frequency of 2.45 GHz to direct current (DC) signals to extend the battery life for further continuous monitoring. The patch is small and has a conformal structure that can easily fit onto different body parts. The screen-printed glucose sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of 10.3 nA cm-2 {\textmu}M-1, a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.9 {\textmu}M, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 27 {\textmu}M. The device employs a photoplethysmography (PPG) module with a peak-finding algorithm to calculate the HRV values. In vivo experiments demonstrate the validation of the device's proper operation in glucose, HRV, and temperature measurement.},

  abstract = {Energy harvesting using various locally available energy sources such as vibration energy, heat, sound, or magnetic field have become attractive topics for supplying power to modular electronic devices making them run independently in extreme environments. In this paper, we will be discussing the perspectives on thermoelectric (TE) and piezoelectric materials and devices, and then the concept of multi-source energy harvester using piezoelectric and thermoelectric devices and integration of them into a reliable and independent power source. TE materials having low thermal conductivity and high figure-of-merit (\emph{zT}) are developed to convert even a small temperature gradient efficiently into electrical energy with the state-of-the-art conversion efficiency of {\textasciitilde}15\% and output power of {\textasciitilde}56W from single device. The piezoelectric device architecture is configured using high performance piezoelectric ceramics (Cu-Mn-PIN-PMN-PT). These ceramics exhibit high piezoelectric coefficient with high mechanical quality factor and low dielectric loss factor. Using these piezoelectric materials, power density as high a 2mW/cm\textsuperscript{2} is demonstrated in 1-1.5g vibration environments. The piezoelectric device is attached on the surface of TE module to capture both the vibration and thermal energy sources to realize dual mode energy harvester. The multi-energy transfer strategy opens opportunities for a future generation of wireless and modular electronic devices. These devices would be useful in powering wearable electronic devices, micro sensor chargers, etc. in extreme environmental conditions using body heat/thermal sources and induced motion/vibrations.},

Wearable biosensors can receive information about human health without the need for external charging, with energy instead provided by collection and storage modules that can be integrated into the biosensors. However, the failure to design suitable components for sensing remains a significant challenge associated with biomedical sensors. Therefore, design of TENG structures based on the human body is a considerable challenge, as biomedical sensors, such as implantable and wearable self-powered sensors, have recently advanced. Following a brief introduction of the fundamentals of triboelectric nanogenerators, we describe implantable and wearable self-powered sensors powered by triboelectric nanogenerators.

Herein, a newly designed wave-powered capacitive deionization system (WPCDIS) was developed for the first time. The system comprises a coaxial hybrid nanogenerator (CH-NG) and a low-energy consuming capacitive deionization (CDI) cell, in which CH-NG is assembled by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an electromagnetic generator (EMG) and a piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) into a coaxial rotating structure to efficiently harvest energy from water wave with a low frequency of down to 0.2~Hz, and the CDI cell with a salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 28.0~mg g-1 at 1.5~V using NaCl solution with a concentration of 500~mg L-1 is fabricated by 3D porous graphene (3DPG) and activated carbon (AC) as the salt ion adsorption electrode. Unlike conventional desalination methods requiring an external power source, the WPCDIS can be run by harvesting wave energy in real time, and exhibits continuous and stable desalination performance. In addition, the test on the ocean also demonstrates the feasibility of the system for practical application.

Heat is a very common source to generate electric energy however the efficiency of equipment using heat as an energy generation source is limited, and it creates huge amounts of heat energy as waste. One of the technologies which has attracted significant attention in the last two decades is thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that can generate electricity from waste heat. After quick research, it is obvious that different active and passive devices can be manufactured not only for big size energy generators but also for the small size and wearable generators which use heat in order to create electric energy via TEGs. In this review, promising results gathered from different applications of TEGs in different industries claimed as well as the basic principles of thermoelectricity and fundamentals of energy harvesting process from temperature gradient. Experiments on TEGs were done by many researchers as well as analytical models through the years, and validated that TEGs are useful for the energy generation.

  abstract = {Thermoelectricity is a promising solution to utilize waste heat for electrical energy, whereas thermal saturation or the temporal absence of thermal gradient incurs discontinuities in energy harvesting. Meanwhile, utilizing humidity has recently emerged as an energy harvesting stimulus owing to its sustainable availability, but its low power output limits feasibility. Herein, we report a humidity-thermoelectric bimodal energy harvester (HT-BET) for sustainable and complementary power generation. Aqueous and air electrothermal wave (ETW) uniformly deposits palladium nitrate precursors and directly fabricates tunable palladium/palladium oxide/carbon-based composites (Pd/PdxOy @C) in terms of morphology, composition, and interfacial characteristics, thereby screening optimal electrochemical electrodes for humidity-driven energy-harvesting cells. An asymmetric cell incorporating a solidified poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH) between screened Pd/PdxOy @C and carbon fibers is integrated with a thermoelectric p--n junction employing Bi2Te3 cells to complete the HT-BEH fabrication. The single HT-BEH exhibits highly improved output power by 67 times (0.3~{\textmu}W), compared with a thermoelectric cell (4.5 nW) at 308.15~K (∆T~=~10.35~K) and 30\% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, the flexible multi-array of HT-BEHs achieves 0.41~{\textmu}W output power for 16~h through the human skin temperature, sweat, and surrounding RH, thereby confirming the capability of sustainable energy sources for wearable platforms in ambient environments.},

  abstract = {The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonrenewable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest energies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed.

This paper starts with an introduction to hybrid energy harvesting, showing different hybrid energy harvester configurations, i.e., the integration of piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric and triboelectric energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic energy harvesters; and others. The output performance of common hybrid systems that are reported in the literature is also outlined in this review. Afterwards, various potential applications of hybrid energy harvesting are discussed, showing the practical attainability of the technology. Finally, this paper concludes by making recommendations for future research to overcome the difficulties in developing hybrid energy harvesters. The recommendations revolve around improving energy conversion efficiency, developing advanced integration techniques, and investigating new hybrid configurations.

  abstract = {There has been an explosion in research focused on Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, with a broad range of use cases in different domains ranging from industrial automation to business analytics. Being battery-powered, these small devices are expected to last for extended periods (i.e., in some instances up to tens of years) to ensure network longevity and data streams with the required temporal and spatial granularity. It becomes even more critical when IoT devices are installed within a harsh environment where battery replacement/charging is both costly and labour intensive. Recent developments in the energy harvesting paradigm have significantly contributed towards mitigating this critical energy issue by incorporating the renewable energy potentially available within any environment in which a sensor network is deployed. Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting is one of the promising approaches being investigated in the research community to address this challenge, conducted by harvesting energy from the incident radio waves from both ambient and dedicated radio sources. A limited number of studies are available covering the state of the art related to specific research topics in this space, but there is a gap in the consolidation of domain knowledge associated with the factors influencing the performance of RF power harvesting systems. Moreover, a number of topics and research challenges affecting the performance of RF harvesting systems are still unreported, which deserve special attention. To this end, this article starts by providing an overview of the different application domains of RF power harvesting outlining their performance requirements and summarizing the RF power harvesting techniques with their associated power densities. It then comprehensively surveys the available literature on the horizons that affect the performance of RF energy harvesting, taking into account the evaluation metrics, power propagation models, rectenna architectures, and MAC protocols for RF energy harvesting. Finally, it summarizes the available literature associated with RF powered networks and highlights the limitations, challenges, and future research directions by synthesizing the research efforts in the field of RF energy harvesting to progress research in this area.},

Emerging implantable and wearable medical (IWM) devices are integral parts of enabling affordable and accessible healthcare. Early disease diagnosis and preventive measures are possible by continuously monitoring clinically significant physiological parameters. However, most IWM devices are battery-operated, requiring replacement, which interrupts the proper functioning of these devices. For the continuous operation of medical devices for an extended period of time, supplying uninterrupted energy is crucial. A sustainable and health-compatible energy supply will ensure the high-performance real-time functioning of IWM devices and prolong their lifetime.

  abstract = {Wearing face masks is an effective non-pharmaceutical strategy to inhibit the transmission of airborne diseases. Nonetheless, most commercial face masks lack disinfecting capabilities, posing risks of secondary transmission, while those with antimicrobial coatings are incapable of instant pathogen inactivation. Herein, a proof-of-concept instant disinfecting face mask is demonstrated consisting of a Cu(OH)2-nanowire electroporation filter powered by a respiration-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG). The R-TENG comprises electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. A dome-shaped PVA membrane is specifically designed to maximize the effective contact area. Coupling the novel dome-shape design with maximized {$\beta$}-phase crystallites of PVDF, the enhanced R-TENG generates an open-circuit voltage of 120 V under the normal breathing rate of an adult, resulting in an amplified electric field of 19 MV m-1 at the nanowire tips of the electroporation filter. Under this high localized electric field, effective inactivation of bacteria ({$>$}99.9\%) is achieved via a synergy of electroporation and physical penetration. Conversely, when the R-TENG is disconnected, only partial inactivation (90\%--99\%) via physical penetration is realized. For the first time, it shows that R-TENG powered electroporation is a viable solution to achieve instant, effective disinfection, paving the way for next-generation face masks.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence and miniaturization of electronic devices have driven global efforts to develop small-scale, self-sustaining, rugged, and ecologically viable power sources. Nanogenerators, with the ability to scavenge ambient energy from the environment, offer an elegant solution to this need for small-scale power sources. A major route of development for nanogenerators has been in integration with other green energy sources. This article discusses one such integrated power source, namely the photovoltaic and nanogenerator hybrid cells. These hybrid cells have come a long way in terms of mechanical integrity, power output, and efficiency since they were first reported in 2009. Each published instance of photovoltaic and nanogenerator hybrid cell is reviewed systematically and the salient points in each case have been discussed. The article has been concluded with a discussion on the current state of this technology, its limitations, and the avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {The human body is a source of multiple types of energy, such as mechanical, thermal and biochemical, which can be scavenged through appropriate technological means. Mechanical vibrations originating from contraction and expansion of the radial artery represent a reliable source of displacement to be picked up and exploited by a harvester. The continuous monitoring of physiological biomarkers is an essential part of the timely and accurate diagnosis of a disease with subsequent medical treatment, and wearable biosensors are increasingly utilized for biomedical data acquisition of important biomarkers. However, they rely on batteries and their replacement introduces a discontinuity in measured signals, which could be critical for the patients and also causes discomfort. In the present work, the research into a novel 3D-printed wearable energy harvesting platform for scavenging energy from arterial pulsations via a piezoelectric material is described. An elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) film, which forms an air chamber between the skin and the piezoelectric disc electrode, was introduced to provide better adsorption to the skin, prevent damage to the piezoelectric disc and electrically isolate components in the platform from the human body. Computational fluid dynamics in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1 software was employed to perform a series of coupled time-varying simulations of the interaction among a number of associated physical phenomena. The mathematical model of the harvester was investigated computationally, and quantification of the output energy and power parameters was used for comparisons. A prototype wearable platform enclosure was designed and manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF). The influence of the piezoelectric disc material and its diameter on the electrical output were studied and various geometrical parameters of the enclosure and the TPU film were optimized based on theoretical and empirical data. Physiological data, such as interdependency between the harvester skin fit and voltage output, were obtained.},

Playing a critical role as the power sources for independent electronic systems, energy harvesters with high flexibility or stretchability have been the focus of research efforts over the past decade. A large number of the flexible energy harvesters developed can only operate at very low strain level ({$\approx$}0.1\%), and their limited flexibility impedes their application in wearable or stretchable electronics. Here, the development of highly flexible and stretchable (stretchability {$>$}15\% strain) energy harvesters is reviewed with emphasis on strategies of materials synthesis, device fabrication, and integration schemes for enhanced flexibility and stretchability.

Biomechanical energy-harvesting technology is a promising approach for operating wearable electronic devices without battery dependence. In this study, a novel noise-less hybrid nanogenerator (NLHN) was developed using 3D-printed elastic resin springs and burr-shaped water-based polyurethane (water-based PU: WPU)@Siloxene nanocomposite to effectively harvest low-frequency biomechanical energy from various human movements without generating any physical noise. By rationally integrating electromagnetic generators with triboelectric nanogenerators in a sliding mode and two contact modes, the proposed NLHN exhibited excellent output performance under random low-frequency and wide-range vibrational excitations. The WPU@Siloxene was first introduced as a highly flexible positive triboelectric layer and a noise suppressor during the sliding mode operation, while elastic resin springs significantly improved the energy harvesting performance thereby suppressing the physical noise during contact-separation. The NLHN exhibited an optimal output power of 101~mW at 6~Hz and 1.5~g acceleration. Moreover, the NLHN suppressed operating noise to only 41~dB during operation and maintained a stable output performance after 50,000 cycles. The NLHN was demonstrated to function as a continuous power source for powering portable and wearable electronics, such as smart bracelets and smartphones as well as battery-free wearable ECG monitoring systems. Conclusively, the proposed NLHN has substantial potential for silent biomechanical energy harvesting as a sustainable and eco-friendly power source for portable electronics and wearable healthcare sensing devices.},

Because of their applications on soft and highly deformable tissues of the human body, these devices also need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable, thus posing a significant challenge. Effective methods to address the challenge include the exploration of new stretchable piezoelectric materials (e.g., hybrid composite material) and stretchable structures (e.g., buckled shapes, serpentine mesh layouts, kirigami designs, among others). This review presents an overview of the recent developments in new intrinsically stretchable piezoelectric materials and rigid inorganic piezoelectric materials with novel stretchable structures for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesters. Following the discussion of theoretical modeling of the piezoelectric materials to convert mechanical deformations into electrical signals, the representative applications of stretchable piezoelectric materials and structures in wearable and implantable devices are briefly summarized. The present limitations and future research directions of flexible and stretchable piezoelectric devices are then discussed.},

  abstract = {Wearable hybrid energy harvesters show enormous potential for supplying power to wearable electronics since they circumvent the issue of discontinuous source energy of single energy harvesters and thereby supply more available energy. The hybridization of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and biofuel cells (BFCs) is promising; however, there are two major challenges. First, the two energy harvesters' outputs are severely mismatched, but optimized power management and design principles have not yet been demonstrated. Second, previously reported devices are based on planar structures and lack breathability. Here, we develop a breathable and woven hybrid energy harvester (BWHEH) that is knitted with a textile TENG and fiber BFCs. A power management circuit is specially designed to match and optimize the output direct current power supply, which can enlarge the output power by {$\sim$}46.1 times, significantly lowering the effective internal impedance of the power source and improving the power delivery for common wearable loading conditions. The design principles of the power management for the TENG--BFC hybrid are thoroughly revealed. The wearable BWHEH self-charging power system can sustainably power various portable electronics by harvesting biomechanical and biochemical energy. This work provides a new route for energy harvesting and offers fundamental guidance for high-power hybrid energy harvesters.},

  abstract = {Triboelectrification is a well-known phenomenon that commonly occurs in nature and in our lives at any time and any place. Although each and every material exhibits triboelectrification, its quantification has not been standardized. A triboelectric series has been qualitatively ranked with regards to triboelectric polarization. Here, we introduce a universal standard method to quantify the triboelectric series for a wide range of polymers, establishing quantitative triboelectrification as a fundamental materials property. By measuring the tested materials with a liquid metal in an environment under well-defined conditions, the proposed method standardizes the experimental set up for uniformly quantifying the surface triboelectrification of general materials. The normalized triboelectric charge density is derived to reveal the intrinsic character of polymers for gaining or losing electrons. This quantitative triboelectric series may serve as a textbook standard for implementing the application of triboelectrification for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing.},

  abstract = {With compelling features of flexibility, conformability, and user friendliness, wearable bioelectronics have undergone tremendous development on account of miniaturization and multifunction advancements which could cater to the development trend of Internet of Things (IoT) and fifth-generation wireless technology. However, powering wearable bioelectronics sustainably and pervasively is beyond the capability of traditional power supply systems and remains a challenge and highly desired. By using the coupling effect of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) were demonstrated to efficiently convert irregular and low-frequency biomechanical energy from human body movements into electrical energy for the sustainable powering of wearable bioelectronics. In this article, the latest representative achievements of wearable TENGs for electricity generation are comprehensively reviewed with the order of the accessible biomechanical energy on the human body from head to feet. This review not only covers the fundamental working mechanism, rational structural design, selection of the tribo-materials, and fabrication process of wearable TENGs, but also investigates the movement patterns and characteristics of each part of the body, as well as its feasibility and convenience for electricity generation. Finally, perspectives and challenges regarding wearable TENGs at present are discussed.},
