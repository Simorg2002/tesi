An energy-harvesting system would be a useful strategy to address the issue of powering wearable electronic devices. This review presents different wearable energy harvesting methods based on the human body's heat and mechanical energy. To achieve continuous operation and high performance, reduce the requirement for external sources of energy, and enhance the lifespan of wearable devices, the invention of a sustainable and compatible power supply is required. In the human body, heat and mechanical motions are the two reliable and readily available energy sources. This study highlights the most recent research and advancements in energy harvesting from the human's mechanical motion and heat source.

  abstract = {Stretchable thermoelectric generators (s-TEGs) have been regarded as promising energy harvesters for self-powered wearable electronics. However, previous s-TEGs show low power generation capacity due to their high module resistances, originating from the poor electromechanical interfaces between rigid--soft components and the high electrical resistances of stretchable interconnects. Herein, we report strategies to boost thermoelectric performance, which allows us to operate wireless communication systems from body heat by generating a power of 2.6 mW. Electromechanically graded interlayers that mediate discrete functionalities at the interfaces effectively reduce junction resistances, and solution-based welding that transforms scattered networks into mesh-like structures produces highly conductive and strain-resilient interconnects, respectively. Soft heat conductors are included to improve thermal interfaces, minimizing thermal impedance of elastomeric substrates. Consequently, the power generation capacity is significantly enhanced, exhibiting the highest normalized power density of 1.48 {$\mu$}W cm--2 K--2 among reported high-performance s-TEGs. Our s-TEGs provide realistic solutions for sustainable self-powered electronics.},

This disruptive technology has helped healthcare professionals with intervening early in chronic diseases, especially amongst independently living patients, and has facilitated real-time monitoring of patients' vital signs remotely. One of the major bottlenecks that hamper the adoption of wearable device is the continuous power supply. Most wearable devices solely depend on battery supply. When the energy stored in the battery is depleted, the operation of wearable devices is affected. To overcome this limitation, efficient energy harvesters for wearable devices are crucial. The paper primarily aims to present a comprehensive classification of different energy sources that can be capitalized to power wearable devices.

The shortage of fossil fuels requires renewable clean energy to replace traditional energy to meet the needs of smart and low-power devices. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a new technology for converting high-entropy mechanical energy into electric energy to power these devices. However, improving the output energy and durability of TENG remains a considerable challenge for practical applications. To solve these problems and push forward its commercialization process, this paper systematically reviews how to improve the durability of the sliding mode TENG (S-TENG) from the aspects of material optimization and structural design. Besides, a variety of ways are introduced to improve the electric output of the S-TENG under the premise of high durability. At last, challenges and future research focus in this field are also predicted, which provide a guideline for the research of the high electric output and ultra-durability TENG for highly efficient energy harvesting and self-powered sensing applications in the IoTs.},

Additionally, we decoupled the complex signals of resistance and thermal voltage during deformation under solar irradiation based on the anisotropy of the knitted fabrics to enable the device to monitor and optimize the outdoor physical activity of the athlete via the APP.

  abstract = {Electric devices has become a necessity in modern smart societies. The energy research community is continually exploring new solutions that can be employed as potential and reliable alternatives to satisfy future energy requirements in this context. Triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators (TNGs/PNGs) are considered promising renewable energy harvesting technologies. TNGs/PNGs are gaining considerable research attention because of their advantages such as ease of fabrication, cost effectiveness, flexibility, lightweightness, long-term-durability, and excellent output performance. The TNGs/PNGs have enormous potential in harvesting energy from water waves (blue energy), airflow (wind energy), sound frequency (acoustic energy), vibrations/mechanical motions (such as body motions activities/sleeping), and in vivo body motions. These technologies are thus an ``all-in-one package,'' which is a unique selling point. The advantage of this technology is that all sources are natural and abundant. This paper provides a review of the potential use of PNGs/TNGs and includes a description of the rise of nanogenerators, their underlying mechanisms, different materials used, various models, possible applications, and future prospects. Stored energy can be used to develop smart/informative technologies (as ultrasensitive sensors) and self-powered biomedical science. Owing to their considerable effects, these harvesting technologies are expected to dominate the future smart world.},

  abstract = {Wearable and mobile devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, wearable medical devices, etc., have become an important part of our daily life. Most of these devices are powered by electrochemical batteries, which have limited energy capacity, need periodic replacement or recharging, and lead to environmental concerns. On the one hand, there is a huge amount of energy stored in the human body and the energy dissipation rate is more than 100 Watts. While on the other hand, the power requirement of typical wearable and mobile devices is less than 1 Watt and keeps decreasing as a result of the rapid development of technologies. Extracting a small amount of energy from the human body can provide enough power for wearable/mobile devices, and enable a convenient, sustainable, eco-friendly, and self-powered alternative to batteries. Many biomechanical energy-harvesting devices have emerged in recent years, of which the excitation source, mechanical modulation, energy conversion method, and performance are vastly different from one another. However, no comprehensive work has been found in the literature that conducted systematical review of the pioneer works from the perspective of modeling of biomechanical energy harvesters. This work reviews the modeling and performance of the state-of-the-art biomechanical energy harvesting devices and classifies them into three categories in terms of excitation mechanisms, specifically, relative-motion-excited, inertia-excited, and force-excited. Different energy-conversion transducers are analyzed and compared, including electromagnetic, piezoelectric, electrostatic, and triboelectric. The evaluation metrics are defined for fair comparisons. The results show that biomechanical energy harvesting has a promising application prospect in many areas, such as health care monitoring systems and wearable electronics, and the current power output and density could be up to 5~W and 10~W/kg. Energy harvesting from negative muscle work may reduce the metabolic cost of human motion while harvesting electrical power. Meanwhile, the review also reveals potential problems that hind the commercialization and practical applications of biomechanical energy harvesting technologies, such as the cost, invasiveness to human body, and interference to human dynamics.},

The interface employs an inductor-shared converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) assistance to convert the piezoelectric energy rectified by a parallel synchronized switch harvesting on capacitor (P-SSHC) rectifier and the thermoelectric energy into a regulated output. The harvester employs an adaptive switching cycle (ASC) scheme to reduce the ripple of the tracking to improve the MPPT accuracy and end-to-end efficiency. In parallel, for efficient harvesting of both sources simultaneously, a multiplexed MPPT technique is incorporated into the harvester to reduce the chip area. In addition, to reduce the power loss resulting from the sampling phase of the FOCV method, a single-cycle fast-sampling technique is employed to assist the piezoelectric energy harvesting. The proposed hybrid energy harvester is fabricated by a 0.18 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm CMOS process with a core area of 1.2 {\textbackslash}times 0.7 mm2. The measured results show that the peak tracking efficiency of the PZT and TEG is 99.58\% and 99.37\%, respectively. The peak of end-to-end efficiency of the interface reaches 86.67\%.},

  abstract = {Energy harvesting using various locally available energy sources such as vibration energy, heat, sound, or magnetic field have become attractive topics for supplying power to modular electronic devices making them run independently in extreme environments. In this paper, we will be discussing the perspectives on thermoelectric (TE) and piezoelectric materials and devices, and then the concept of multi-source energy harvester using piezoelectric and thermoelectric devices and integration of them into a reliable and independent power source. TE materials having low thermal conductivity and high figure-of-merit (\emph{zT}) are developed to convert even a small temperature gradient efficiently into electrical energy with the state-of-the-art conversion efficiency of {\textasciitilde}15\% and output power of {\textasciitilde}56W from single device. The piezoelectric device architecture is configured using high performance piezoelectric ceramics (Cu-Mn-PIN-PMN-PT). These ceramics exhibit high piezoelectric coefficient with high mechanical quality factor and low dielectric loss factor. Using these piezoelectric materials, power density as high a 2mW/cm\textsuperscript{2} is demonstrated in 1-1.5g vibration environments. The piezoelectric device is attached on the surface of TE module to capture both the vibration and thermal energy sources to realize dual mode energy harvester. The multi-energy transfer strategy opens opportunities for a future generation of wireless and modular electronic devices. These devices would be useful in powering wearable electronic devices, micro sensor chargers, etc. in extreme environmental conditions using body heat/thermal sources and induced motion/vibrations.},

Wearable biosensors can receive information about human health without the need for external charging, with energy instead provided by collection and storage modules that can be integrated into the biosensors. However, the failure to design suitable components for sensing remains a significant challenge associated with biomedical sensors. Therefore, design of TENG structures based on the human body is a considerable challenge, as biomedical sensors, such as implantable and wearable self-powered sensors, have recently advanced. Following a brief introduction of the fundamentals of triboelectric nanogenerators, we describe implantable and wearable self-powered sensors powered by triboelectric nanogenerators. Moreover, we examine the constraints limiting the practical uses of self-powered devices.},

Heat is a very common source to generate electric energy however the efficiency of equipment using heat as an energy generation source is limited, and it creates huge amounts of heat energy as waste. One of the technologies which has attracted significant attention in the last two decades is thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that can generate electricity from waste heat. After quick research, it is obvious that different active and passive devices can be manufactured not only for big size energy generators but also for the small size and wearable generators which use heat in order to create electric energy via TEGs. In this review, promising results gathered from different applications of TEGs in different industries claimed as well as the basic principles of thermoelectricity and fundamentals of energy harvesting process from temperature gradient. Experiments on TEGs were done by many researchers as well as analytical models through the years, and validated that TEGs are useful for the energy generation.

  abstract = {Thermoelectricity is a promising solution to utilize waste heat for electrical energy, whereas thermal saturation or the temporal absence of thermal gradient incurs discontinuities in energy harvesting. Meanwhile, utilizing humidity has recently emerged as an energy harvesting stimulus owing to its sustainable availability, but its low power output limits feasibility. Herein, we report a humidity-thermoelectric bimodal energy harvester (HT-BET) for sustainable and complementary power generation. Aqueous and air electrothermal wave (ETW) uniformly deposits palladium nitrate precursors and directly fabricates tunable palladium/palladium oxide/carbon-based composites (Pd/PdxOy @C) in terms of morphology, composition, and interfacial characteristics, thereby screening optimal electrochemical electrodes for humidity-driven energy-harvesting cells. An asymmetric cell incorporating a solidified poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH) between screened Pd/PdxOy @C and carbon fibers is integrated with a thermoelectric p--n junction employing Bi2Te3 cells to complete the HT-BEH fabrication. The single HT-BEH exhibits highly improved output power by 67 times (0.3~{\textmu}W), compared with a thermoelectric cell (4.5 nW) at 308.15~K (∆T~=~10.35~K) and 30\% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, the flexible multi-array of HT-BEHs achieves 0.41~{\textmu}W output power for 16~h through the human skin temperature, sweat, and surrounding RH, thereby confirming the capability of sustainable energy sources for wearable platforms in ambient environments.},

  abstract = {The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonrenewable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest energies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed.

This paper starts with an introduction to hybrid energy harvesting, showing different hybrid energy harvester configurations, i.e., the integration of piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric and triboelectric energy harvesters; the integration of piezoelectric, triboelectric, and electromagnetic energy harvesters; and others. The output performance of common hybrid systems that are reported in the literature is also outlined in this review. Afterwards, various potential applications of hybrid energy harvesting are discussed, showing the practical attainability of the technology. Finally, this paper concludes by making recommendations for future research to overcome the difficulties in developing hybrid energy harvesters. The recommendations revolve around improving energy conversion efficiency, developing advanced integration techniques, and investigating new hybrid configurations.

  abstract = {There has been an explosion in research focused on Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, with a broad range of use cases in different domains ranging from industrial automation to business analytics. Being battery-powered, these small devices are expected to last for extended periods (i.e., in some instances up to tens of years) to ensure network longevity and data streams with the required temporal and spatial granularity. It becomes even more critical when IoT devices are installed within a harsh environment where battery replacement/charging is both costly and labour intensive. Recent developments in the energy harvesting paradigm have significantly contributed towards mitigating this critical energy issue by incorporating the renewable energy potentially available within any environment in which a sensor network is deployed. Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting is one of the promising approaches being investigated in the research community to address this challenge, conducted by harvesting energy from the incident radio waves from both ambient and dedicated radio sources. A limited number of studies are available covering the state of the art related to specific research topics in this space, but there is a gap in the consolidation of domain knowledge associated with the factors influencing the performance of RF power harvesting systems. Moreover, a number of topics and research challenges affecting the performance of RF harvesting systems are still unreported, which deserve special attention. To this end, this article starts by providing an overview of the different application domains of RF power harvesting outlining their performance requirements and summarizing the RF power harvesting techniques with their associated power densities. It then comprehensively surveys the available literature on the horizons that affect the performance of RF energy harvesting, taking into account the evaluation metrics, power propagation models, rectenna architectures, and MAC protocols for RF energy harvesting. Finally, it summarizes the available literature associated with RF powered networks and highlights the limitations, challenges, and future research directions by synthesizing the research efforts in the field of RF energy harvesting to progress research in this area.},

Emerging implantable and wearable medical (IWM) devices are integral parts of enabling affordable and accessible healthcare. Early disease diagnosis and preventive measures are possible by continuously monitoring clinically significant physiological parameters. However, most IWM devices are battery-operated, requiring replacement, which interrupts the proper functioning of these devices. For the continuous operation of medical devices for an extended period of time, supplying uninterrupted energy is crucial. A sustainable and health-compatible energy supply will ensure the high-performance real-time functioning of IWM devices and prolong their lifetime.

  abstract = {The human body is a source of multiple types of energy, such as mechanical, thermal and biochemical, which can be scavenged through appropriate technological means. Mechanical vibrations originating from contraction and expansion of the radial artery represent a reliable source of displacement to be picked up and exploited by a harvester. The continuous monitoring of physiological biomarkers is an essential part of the timely and accurate diagnosis of a disease with subsequent medical treatment, and wearable biosensors are increasingly utilized for biomedical data acquisition of important biomarkers. However, they rely on batteries and their replacement introduces a discontinuity in measured signals, which could be critical for the patients and also causes discomfort. In the present work, the research into a novel 3D-printed wearable energy harvesting platform for scavenging energy from arterial pulsations via a piezoelectric material is described. An elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) film, which forms an air chamber between the skin and the piezoelectric disc electrode, was introduced to provide better adsorption to the skin, prevent damage to the piezoelectric disc and electrically isolate components in the platform from the human body. Computational fluid dynamics in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1 software was employed to perform a series of coupled time-varying simulations of the interaction among a number of associated physical phenomena. The mathematical model of the harvester was investigated computationally, and quantification of the output energy and power parameters was used for comparisons. A prototype wearable platform enclosure was designed and manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF). The influence of the piezoelectric disc material and its diameter on the electrical output were studied and various geometrical parameters of the enclosure and the TPU film were optimized based on theoretical and empirical data. Physiological data, such as interdependency between the harvester skin fit and voltage output, were obtained.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancements of wearable electronics have caused a paradigm shift in consumer electronics, and the emerging development of stretchable electronics opens a new spectrum of applications for electronic systems. Playing a critical role as the power sources for independent electronic systems, energy harvesters with high flexibility or stretchability have been the focus of research efforts over the past decade. A large number of the flexible energy harvesters developed can only operate at very low strain level ({$\approx$}0.1\%), and their limited flexibility impedes their application in wearable or stretchable electronics. Here, the development of highly flexible and stretchable (stretchability {$>$}15\% strain) energy harvesters is reviewed with emphasis on strategies of materials synthesis, device fabrication, and integration schemes for enhanced flexibility and stretchability. Due to their particular potential applications in wearable and stretchable electronics, energy-harvesting devices based on piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, thermoelectricity, and dielectric elastomers have been largely developed and the progress is summarized. The challenges and opportunities of assembly and integration of energy harvesters into stretchable systems are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of portable and wearable electronics demands innovative battery solutions that are both sustainable and eco-friendly. Biomechanical energy-harvesting technology is a promising approach for operating wearable electronic devices without battery dependence. In this study, a novel noise-less hybrid nanogenerator (NLHN) was developed using 3D-printed elastic resin springs and burr-shaped water-based polyurethane (water-based PU: WPU)@Siloxene nanocomposite to effectively harvest low-frequency biomechanical energy from various human movements without generating any physical noise. By rationally integrating electromagnetic generators with triboelectric nanogenerators in a sliding mode and two contact modes, the proposed NLHN exhibited excellent output performance under random low-frequency and wide-range vibrational excitations. The WPU@Siloxene was first introduced as a highly flexible positive triboelectric layer and a noise suppressor during the sliding mode operation, while elastic resin springs significantly improved the energy harvesting performance thereby suppressing the physical noise during contact-separation. The NLHN exhibited an optimal output power of 101~mW at 6~Hz and 1.5~g acceleration. Moreover, the NLHN suppressed operating noise to only 41~dB during operation and maintained a stable output performance after 50,000 cycles. The NLHN was demonstrated to function as a continuous power source for powering portable and wearable electronics, such as smart bracelets and smartphones as well as battery-free wearable ECG monitoring systems. Conclusively, the proposed NLHN has substantial potential for silent biomechanical energy harvesting as a sustainable and eco-friendly power source for portable electronics and wearable healthcare sensing devices.},

However, energy harvesting and power generation beneath the human tissue are still a major challenge. In this regard, self-powered implantable devices that scavenge energy from the human body are attractive for long-term monitoring of human physiological traits. Thanks to advancements in material science and nanotechnology, energy harvesting techniques that rely on piezoelectricity, thermoelectricity, biofuel, and radio frequency power transfer are emerging. However, all these techniques suffer from limitations that include low power output, bulky size, or low efficiency. Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion is one of the most promising candidates for implantable applications due to their higher-power conversion efficiencies and small footprint. Herein, the latest implantable energy harvesting technologies are surveyed. A comparison between the different state-of-the-art power harvesting methods is also provided. Finally, recommendations are provided regarding the feasibility of PV cells as an in vivo energy harvester, with an emphasis on skin penetration, fabrication, encapsulation, durability, biocompatibility, and power management.},

  abstract = {Wearable and implantable bio-integrated electronics have started to gain momentum because of their essential role in improving the quality of life for various patients and healthy individuals. However, their continuous operation is often limited by traditional battery technologies with a limited lifespan, creating a significant challenge for their development. Thus, it is highly desirable to harvest biomechanical energies from human motion for self-powered bio-integrated functional devices. Piezoelectric energy harvesters are ideal candidates to achieve this goal by converting biomechanical energy to electric energy. Because of their applications on soft and highly deformable tissues of the human body, these devices also need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable, thus posing a significant challenge. Effective methods to address the challenge include the exploration of new stretchable piezoelectric materials (e.g., hybrid composite material) and stretchable structures (e.g., buckled shapes, serpentine mesh layouts, kirigami designs, among others). This review presents an overview of the recent developments in new intrinsically stretchable piezoelectric materials and rigid inorganic piezoelectric materials with novel stretchable structures for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesters. Following the discussion of theoretical modeling of the piezoelectric materials to convert mechanical deformations into electrical signals, the representative applications of stretchable piezoelectric materials and structures in wearable and implantable devices are briefly summarized. The present limitations and future research directions of flexible and stretchable piezoelectric devices are then discussed.},

The hybridization of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and biofuel cells (BFCs) is promising; however, there are two major challenges. First, the two energy harvesters' outputs are severely mismatched, but optimized power management and design principles have not yet been demonstrated. Second, previously reported devices are based on planar structures and lack breathability. Here, we develop a breathable and woven hybrid energy harvester (BWHEH) that is knitted with a textile TENG and fiber BFCs. A power management circuit is specially designed to match and optimize the output direct current power supply, which can enlarge the output power by {$\sim$}46.1 times, significantly lowering the effective internal impedance of the power source and improving the power delivery for common wearable loading conditions. The design principles of the power management for the TENG--BFC hybrid are thoroughly revealed. The wearable BWHEH self-charging power system can sustainably power various portable electronics by harvesting biomechanical and biochemical energy. This work provides a new route for energy harvesting and offers fundamental guidance for high-power hybrid energy harvesters.},

Here, we introduce a universal standard method to quantify the triboelectric series for a wide range of polymers, establishing quantitative triboelectrification as a fundamental materials property. By measuring the tested materials with a liquid metal in an environment under well-defined conditions, the proposed method standardizes the experimental set up for uniformly quantifying the surface triboelectrification of general materials. The normalized triboelectric charge density is derived to reveal the intrinsic character of polymers for gaining or losing electrons.
